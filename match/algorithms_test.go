// Rationale behind clearing price matching:
// On a typical exchange, if, for example you have US dollars and are trying to buy BTC,
// then a higher price for your order will get you priority, but a lower price is always better
// for you, and you will always take a lower price if you can get it.
// The price is determined as USD/BTC, or have/want.
// In our model, if you have one asset and are trying to buy another asset then your price will
// be in want/have.
// If you are a buyer, this means a lower price will get you priority, but you will take any
// price that is higher.
// If you are a seller, the opposite is true.
// So in clearing matching, if I were to have an order that is priced at $5/btc, and I am a buyer
// then I will get priority over an order that is $4/btc because 1/5 < 1/4. If I receive a price
// of 1btc/4usd, or $4/btc, then I will still be satisfied. I will only have to give up 4 of my
// dollars.
// If I am a seller, and I put in an order priced at $3/btc, or 1btc/3usd, then I will get priority
// over any sell order > 1/3, since that means those orders want more usd for the same amount of btc.
// If I receive a price of 1btc/4usd, or $4/btc, then I will still be satisfied, since I will get
// more usd and give up the same amount of btc.
// This price of $4/btc, or 1btc/4usd, will be one of our trivial tests.
